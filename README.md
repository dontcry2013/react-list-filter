## Homepage
Due to back-end's configuration, you may need to install cross-cors plugin in your browser.

For the development of this application, I use [allow-cors-access-control](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=en-GB) and Chrome.

Please configure as appropriate.
